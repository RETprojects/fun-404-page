# fun-404-page
This is a 404 page designed to have a retro feeling, with the words "YOU ARE LOST" floating back and forth like ghosts. There is also a Youtube link to a song that visitors can listen to while figuring out which page to visit instead: a live version of "They Got Lost" by They Might Be Giants.
This was made during Global Hack Week: AI/ML Week from Major League Hacking.
